University Theater By-Laws



University Theater's Mission Statement

University Theater provides students with the opportunity to have artistic control of every production aspect of shows presented under the UT banner. University Theater enables members of the University community to explore and practice the many aspects of theater.



UT has three main goals that guide its decision making.





*    **Opportunity:** To provide opportunities for members of the University of Chicago community to present and to experience theater.
*   **Education:** To improve the work we do and to learn from successes and mistakes. Peer mentorship and collaboration with TAPS as a co-curricular program are both means through which we strive to learn and teach. Students need not be a TAPS major to participate in UT, or vice versa.
*   **Artistic Excellence:** To support the artistic achievements in student work.



General Membership Guidelines

Though membership of UT consists almost entirely of students, the organization is open to all members of the University: students, faculty, staff, and alumni.



Governing Bodies

University Theater is governed by the UT Student Committee and advised and supported by UT/TAPS Professional Staff (Pro-Staff). Additionally, Off-Off Campus and the Dean's Men report to UT committee in the form of a liaison; each organization has its own set of governing guidelines. The by-laws for each of UT's bodies (UT, Dean's Men, and Off-Off Campus) follow.



# The University Theater Committee


## Duties and Responsibilities
  1. As the governing body of University Theater, the UT Committee represents the UT community's interests to the UT/TAPS Professional Staff and to the University at large. The students on Committee maintain artistic control of University Theater, scheduling its productions and encouraging the creative development of the community.
  2. Individual Committee members should BE COMMITTED to the overall improvement of the organization and its ability to provide opportunities to those who participate in theater at the University of Chicago. Although elected members often play important roles in other aspects of UT and its productions, they must remain committed first and foremost to fulfilling their duties as Committee members. These duties and responsibilities include but are not limited to:

##### Other Positions

Further officer positions may be created by each new Committee to serve its own needs and those of the community. Frequently such positions include liaisons to organizations outside the Performing Arts Roundtable, such as FOTA.




#### Terms of Office and Eligibility

Officers' terms are from the time of election through the end of the following winter quarter. If an officer needs to be replaced prior to this time, a special officer election shall be held at a regular Committee meeting. Officers can be replaced by a two-thirds majority vote of the Committee. In the case of absences, each officer may designate another Committee member to fulfill their duties.

### Meetings

#### Frequency

The Committee meets regularly, once a week during the regular school term (Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters). Meetings are at 5pm on Monday evening. Any member of the Committee may ask the Chair of the Committee to call a special meeting, at which point a phone or email poll of the other members will determine if quorum can be reached, at which point a meeting is held. Regular Committee meetings should be scheduled for at least one hour with a reasonable amount of time set aside for accidentals, incidentals, and unforeseen important business. Committee members should not schedule rehearsals, builds, etc. that conflict with the already-scheduled Committee meetings. Members who wish to have item put on the agenda should contact the Chair of the Committee at least 24 hours before the meeting.




#### Agendas and Minutes

The agenda for the meeting should be emailed to the Committee 24 hours before the meeting. Minutes of the meeting should be posted to the UT Committee Executive Session listhost by the Secretary within 24 hours of the end of the meeting. These minutes must clearly demarcate Executive Session (closed meeting) minutes from for-public minutes. Committee has an additional 24 hours after this point to suggest any changes in information, wording, or regarding the demarcation, or to make further additions. After this period, the Secretary posts the minutes, with Executive Session minutes removed, to the UT general listhost. Any changes to by-laws occurring in a Committee meeting must be noted in the public minutes.

#### Attendance and Quorum
Committee meetings, with the exception of the Mainstage Proposal Meeting and open forums, are closed ('Executive Session'). Quorum for a regular meeting is a majority of voting members. For a proposal meeting, at least four of those members must be elected, non-staff student members.


#### Voting

General issues are voted on by 'secret ballot,' either on paper or by secret show of hands. A member of UT/TAPS Pro-staff tallies the votes. At any point during a Committee meeting, a Committee member can request the issue at hand be put to a vote.

#### Open Session
Meetings are in open session starting at 5pm during this time any member of the UT community is welcome to join the meetings. This open session moves to executive session during which time meeting guests can no longer sit in on the meeting. In addition to this chance to join a meeting, any member of the community can request a place on the agenda before the meeting to bring up issues, concerns or questions. This can be done by contacting the Committee Chair or any other member of Committee prior to said meeting.

## Committee Policies




### Grievances

In the event that a community member or members, or Committee member or members, feel that a member or members of Committee have acted inappropriately (i.e., does not fulfill the responsibilities as outlined in Section I.A.2), they may propose the issue to the Committee Chair within 24 hours of the meeting. In such circumstances, each side should be allowed to make its case. Committee members directly involved in the complaint will then be excused while the remainder of Committee determines a response in an Executive Session. If the Committee determines that the Committee member or members have acted inappropriately, formal responses can range from censure (i.e. a public statement in the minutes) to removal from the Committee.

### Fairness

If a community or Committee member or members are concerned about a Committee member's ability to vote fairly during a proposal meeting or regular meeting, the Chair should ask publicly or privately that the individual or individuals in question consider their fairness. If the situation has not changed, any member of the Committee may ask for a vote on the person's further participation in the process, which can include removal from vote or discussion. Should the Committee Member choose to remove themself from the vote, they may have the opportunity to state so at the beginning of the proposal meeting.  If the Chair is an individual in question, the Director of UT/TAPS should be approached.




### Budgeting and Financial Matters

All Mainstage productions that pass the proposal process and are scheduled in a Logan Center theater have a budget of $2500 to work with. All Mainstage productions that pass the proposal process and are scheduled outside of a Logan Center theater (e.g. outdoor shows, the FXK) have a budget of $1500 to work with. Funding is contingent on a member of the production presenting designs and a budget at the Uber Production Meeting.




### Open Session

Meetings are in open session starting at 5pm during this time any member of the UT community is welcome to join the meetings. This open session moves to executive session during which time meeting guests can no longer sit in on the meeting. In addition to this chance to join a meeting, any member of the community can request a place on the agenda before the meeting to bring up issues, concerns or questions. This can be done by contacting the Committee Chair 24 hours prior to said meeting. A community member may contact any member of Committee and it is the responsibility of that specific member to contact the Chair 24 hours prior to the meeting.

### Amending the By-Laws

These by-laws can be amended by a two-thirds vote of the entire Committee. After each meeting, any amendments to the by-laws must be made in the Secretary's running copy of the by-laws and noted by the Secretary in the public committee meeting minutes. After the final (10th Week) meeting of each quarter, the Secretary emails the most recent edition of the bylaws and the UT Production Manual to the UT general listhost if there have been changes that quarter, as well as prints updated hard copies to keep intheir mailbox outside the UT Suite.

# The Dean's Men

## Purpose

Founded in 2006, The Dean's Men is a student organization at the University of Chicago dedicated to the works of William Shakespeare. Through University Theater productions and other activities, we strive to bring the Bard's writing to the school and create a community of theater makers in the process. We are dedicated to this community, which prospers through social events as well as the rehearsal process. We believe in the importance of its warm, joyous existence. As we continue to cultivate and strengthen our art, so we continue to cultivate and strengthen our community. Once a Dean's Man, always a Dean's Man.

In addition to our quarterly University Theater show, we take part in community outreach, engage with academic resources, and participate in other artist and social endeavors. In the past, such endeavors have included directing a yearly Shakespeare show with local middle school students at St. Thomas Academy, organizing bi-weekly play readings, and hosting gatherings with David Bevington, the world-renowned Shakespeare scholar.



## Production Process


The Dean's Men will perform three shows per year. Once a director and show have been selected for a particular quarter, the Board will assist the director in filling a staff and finding a space, as need be. The selected Dean's Men show is then submitted to University Theater so that a space and week may be selected with sensitivity to the UT season (see below). The Dean's Men productions, as UT productions, will fully participate in UT production requirements such as arbitration and space scheduling.


If a show passes the Dean's Men voting process during Fall or Winter Quarter, this production automatically goes into the Fall or Winter Quarter UT schedules. After a show has passed, a space request will be submitted for the Francis X. Kinahan (FXK) Theater. If the passed director/proposer opts to propose for a different UT space, Committee may consider this option during the scheduling portion of the quarterly Committee Proposal Meeting. No pro/con or other merit-based discussion of the proposed production will occur in the Committee Proposal Meeting once the show has been passed in the Dean's Men voting process. If the FXK theater or other desired space is not available, the Dean's Men will consult Pro-Staff for alternate locations.




The same above holds true for the Spring Quarter production, substituting Logan Courtyard for the FXK. Upholding long-standing University of Chicago tradition, The Dean's Men will do everything in their power to make this Spring Quarter production an outdoors production, even if it is held in an outdoor location other than Logan Courtyard. Should an excellent case be made in a proposal for an inside Spring show, however, the Dean's Men may vote for it in their proposal voting process. Should this decision affect space rental fees and therefore budgets, The Dean's Men will meet with Pro-Staff and Committee prior to the Committee Proposal Meeting to discuss alternate locations and determine the best course of action on a case by case basis.


The Dean's Men will be allocated a design budget for each production by Pro-Staff in accordance with the UT budgeting process. All box-office proceeds from Dean's Men shows will be considered UT profit and treated as such. The spring show is traditionally free and will not have box-office proceeds.


During show weekend, the Production Manager will serve as House Manager and cooperate with the UT Front of House Manager assigned to the performance. Board members are subject to ushering duties as needed.

## Dean's Men Activities and University Theater


The Dean's Men retain the right to perform sonnets, collections of scenes, etc. throughout the school year and summer as opportunities arise and as they see fit. The Dean's Men understand that when they engage in these opportunities they are representing the Shakespeare face of University Theater and will act accordingly.



## Artistic Autonomy


The Dean's Men Board retains the right to give respectful input and feedback for Dean's Men shows as the occasion arises. However, directors for Dean's Men shows maintain complete artistic autonomy. Directors and designers may make whatever choices they deem fit and use available resources to support their vision for the show, provided that they cause neither emotional nor physical harm. Barring extreme circumstances, individuals working on a Dean's Men show as a director, designer, actor, or assistant may not accept another position on the same show (e.g. a director may not also be a designer or actor, and the reverse is true).



## Membership


Consistent with the inclusive motto of the organization – "Once a Dean's Man, always a Dean's Man" – the Dean's Men membership consists of all individuals who have a show credit on a Dean's Men production. Show credits include directors, head designers, production managers, stage managers, actors, assistants, and other positions (including board ops and stage hands) at the discretion of the production manager and director. However, Voting Membership shall be limited to members of the Dean's Men currently enrolled in or working at the University of Chicago.


### Participation

Any community member who is currently enrolled in or working at the University of Chicago is eligible to participate in a Dean's Men production and gain membership status. Alumni members are welcome to participate in productions at the discretion of active members.  



## Board Meetings


Regular Board Meetings are held on a weekly basis in order to discuss the business of the organization. All Board members and the current Dean's Men director are expected to attend; other delegates from the current Dean's Men production (such as managers) are encouraged to attend as well. Board Meetings are open to the public. Decisions regarding organization events, activities, and non-production budget are made at Board Meetings through thorough discussion. In certain cases, the Board may choose to put decisions to a vote. In all cases, consensus is sought. The Board will meet in an executive session following the open Board meeting. Other non-Board members can be invited to the executive session at the Board's discretion. Public Board Meeting minutes are sent out to the Dean's Men and UT General listhosts following each meeting.



## Board Positions

All members of the Dean's Men Board shall operate as co-liaisons to the Dean's Men quarterly production. They are responsible for communicating effectively and alerting all relevant parties (including other Board Members) of issues that arise.



## Voting Procedure


All voting held by the Dean's Men (e.g. show proposals and board elections) will be decided by majority vote whenever possible. The voting process is to be conducted as follows:



    1. All voters will be asked to rank all of the possible candidates on their ballots in their order of preference.
    2. The Board will count all of the first-choice votes for each candidate. If any candidate receives a majority (that is, over 50%) of the votes, then that candidate automatically wins.
    3. If no candidate receives a majority, then all votes cast for the candidate with the _fewest_ votes will be redistributed to the second-choice candidate listed on each ballot. If any candidate has a majority at this point, then that candidate automatically wins.
    4. This process is repeated (eliminating the ballots cast for the candidate with the fewest votes and redistributing them to the highest-ranked choice that has not yet been eliminated) until one candidate receives a majority vote.

If all but two candidates have been eliminated via this process and the result is a tie, then the procedure for Board Elections is as follows: The most recent round of runoffs is undone and the candidate with the most votes wins.


In the event of a tie in proposals, the procedure is as follows: There is a discussion and re-vote with the two tied candidates, and the candidate with the most votes wins. If a tie occurs once again between these two proposals, the Board will vote. If there is a tie within the Board vote, then a coin will be flipped to determine the show.


## Board Elections


    The Board is elected by Voting Members of the organization (as defined in Section 5) at an annual meeting specifically designated as the Board Election Meeting. Said meeting will take place midway through Spring Quarter. Voting takes place for Board positions in the order stated above, starting with the President. Positions may be added, subtracted, and/or altered in response to current organization conditions and requirements as the present Board deems fit.


    An email will be sent out well in advance of the Board Election Meeting calling for people to run for Board positions. To be eligible to run for a Dean's Men Board position, a Voting Member of the organization must send in a statement of intent, including all of the positions they intend to run for. At the Board Election meeting, each candidate will present a brief statement and participate in a two minute question and answer session. Time will be kept by the Treasurer. Once all candidates complete their two minute question and answer session, all Voting Members will cast their votes by secret ballot. A majority vote is needed to elect a candidate (see Section 8 for our voting procedure). The current President and Secretary will announce the results at that time. Then voting for the following positions will go through the same process.


    Dean's Men members who are not able to attend the Board Election meeting may vote for the representatives of their choice in absentia via email and/or Google Doc, to be managed by the Secretary. These absent voters are expected to read the statements of intents submitted by all directors prior to submitting their vote to the Secretary. They are required to provide at least one show credit for proof of voting, as well as a valid excuse (such as work, illness, class, study abroad, etc.) for their absence.




    The new Board takes office during the next academic year, though they shall be trained in their new positions and aid the outgoing Board in the interim. The new Board is expected to attend all Dean's Men Board meetings after they are elected. The incoming President will be expected to attend Performing Arts Roundtable meetings along with the current President. Terms last for a full academic year. In the event of a midterm vacancy, the relevant Chair will nominate a replacement. The Board will then be responsible for approving that nominee.



## Show Proposals


    Any member of the University Community is welcome to propose to direct for the Dean's Men. All proposals will consist of filling out the proposal form created by the Board. Alterations to this form may be made as necessary to reflect changing values by the Board. Directors do not need staff or sketches to accompany their proposals. However, directors are requested to propose with a space and time in mind, as well as conceptions of their designs for the show. Proposal forms must be submitted by the announced deadline during the Quarter prior to the production. Proposals shall be submitted via email to the Board ([board.shakespeare@lists.uchicago.edu](mailto:board.shakespeare@lists.uchicago.edu)) and in the form of two hardcopies in the Board's mailbox. At that time, proposers should email the Board listhost with the names of at least three Board members with whom they would like to meet to discuss their proposals.



## Selection of Proposals


    The Board will determine a meeting time to select a proposal. The Dean's Men autonomous voting meeting will always occur a week prior to the Committee Proposal Meeting, so that Dean's Men proposers may propose for other UT spaces than the FXK or Logan Courtyard. The Board will announce the meeting time and distribute copies of proposals to all interested Dean's Men. Before the proposal meeting proper, all proposers must meet with at least three Board members to discuss their proposals.  




    At the proposal meeting, proposers will take turns speaking for five minutes about their proposals without any other proposers in the room. They will then take part in a question and answer session, and answer clarifying questions for eight minutes from Voting Members of the Dean's Men. The Treasurer will keep time. All relevant parties are welcome to come to the proposal meeting and hear the general statements, however, only Voting Members of the Dean's Men may stay for the question and answer sessions.




    Following each question and answer session, directors are asked to leave the room. Once all directors have been questioned, the remaining Voting Members of the Dean's Men will discuss the proposals and vote by secret ballot. For voting procedure, see Section 8. Dean's Men members who are not able to attend the proposal meeting may vote for a show of their choice in absentia via email and/or Google Doc, to be managed by the Secretary. These absent voters are expected to read the proposal documents submitted by all directors prior to submitting their vote to the Secretary. They are required to provide at least one show credit for proof of voting, as well as a valid excuse (such as work, illness, class, study abroad, etc.) for their absence.  

## Non-Production Activities

## Amendments


    At any time, the Board of the Dean's Men reserves the right to amend or change our bylaws as required by changes in circumstance, opinion, or values. All changes to the bylaws must reach majority vote by the Board and then require ratification by University Theater Committee.

# Off-Off Campus

Off-Off Campus, University Theater's improvisational comedy troupe, was founded in 1986 by Frank Kinahan, Bernie Sahlins, Steve Schroer, and a number of students.  Each Fall, Winter, and Spring Quarter, Off-Off Campus performs a new comedy revue consisting of five Friday night shows (4th through 8th Week) at the Blue Gargoyle Theater in University Church.  The Revues consist of original sketches and long and short form improvisation, directed, written, and performed by the members of Off-Off Campus.  Off-Off also performs a summer season (length and dates vary) in the Logan Center for the Arts, and performs a variety of special shows including the "O-Week Show" in Mandel Hall.



Like any other UT Mainstage show, the costs associated with the production are covered by ticket sales.  And, like any other UT show any profit made is used for the benefit of the entire organization; this includes upkeep of spaces, general publicity, props, competition fees, etc. However, unlike any other UT Mainstage show, the UT Committee does not control Off-Off-Campus' schedule.



Herein, Off-Off Campus may be referred to as "Off-Off" or "OOC" for brevity's sake.

## Membership, Business Meetings, and Voting

### Membership


    a.       _Membership Status_.

                        		i. Off-Off Campus Membership is based on a Generational system. Each member


            of Off-Off Campus belongs to a Generation, comprised of the cohort cast at the beginning of the academic year. The 1st Generation was cast in 1986, the 2nd in 1987, etc. No member may change Generations. Off-Off Membership is broken into two categories: Active Members and Alumni.


                A.    _Active Members_. All collegiate members of Off-Off Campus are given Active Status. A generation and its members has active status for four consecutive years. If a member graduates or leaves the College prior to their Generation completing those four years, then that member's status changes from Active to Alumni.


                B.     _Alumni_. All graduated members of Off-Off Campus, or members of Off-Off Campus whose generations have graduated, are given Alumni status. Alumni are welcome to come back and perform/ direct at the discretion of the current active members.


                                 	 ii.      In the rare case that a member of OOC needs to be removed, active


            members of the group must be notified 2 weeks in advance that the next business meeting will include a vote to remove a member(s) from the group.  The Production Manager must approve any request for a vote to remove a member. A vote of 3/4 of those present is necessary to take away a person's membership status.




    b.      _Performing Generation_.


                 i.      After being cast in Off-Off Campus (See Audition Procedure, section III.B.3), the New Generation must undergo 2 consecutive quarters of training (see Training the New Generation, section III.D.1). The New Generation may not participate in other Off-Off shows or competitions during this time.


                  ii.      Directly following the 2 quarters of training, the New Generation becomes the Performing Generation.


                iii.      The Performing Generation performs 2 Consecutive Revues (Spring and Fall), selects their directors, is the creative face of Off-Off for the duration of their time as the Performing Generation. The Performing Generation has first priority for any extra performances and other opportunities that arise during their tenure as Performing Generation, provided they do not conflict with the Revue rehearsal and performance schedule.


                iv.      After completing 2 consecutive quarters of training followed by 2 consecutive Revues, the Generation forfeits the title of "Performing Generation" and rejoins the ranks of Active Off-Off Members.

    IV.A.3.f.



### Mainstage Proposal Executive Session


        a.       Directly after the community-wide meeting, Committee goes into Executive Session to discuss each proposal individually. In this meeting, Committee considers whether a show:


            i.      Is appropriate to the proposer in terms of its scope and the proposer's relevant experience.


            ii.      Identifies the proposer's focused goals for the production and communicates that the proposer has a clear and specific vision of the play.


            iii.      Fits with University Theater's Mission Statement of Opportunity, Education, and Artistic Excellence.


            iv.      Contains an appropriate staff, including Director, Stage Manager, and Design Team. (Filling the staff as best as possible by the proposal meeting is highly recommended.)


            v.      Is of feasible technical difficulty and requirements, given current University Theater equipment and personnel.




    b.      _Procedure and Policy for the Committee Proposal Meeting_


            i.      The Proposal Meeting is run by the Director of UT/TAPS and the Committee Chair. If the Chair is proposing, the Treasurer runs the meeting. If the Treasurer is also proposing, the Secretary runs the meeting. If all three officers are proposing, another member of Committee will be selected at the prior Committee meeting by simple majority vote.


            ii.      Committee does not vote for or against a proposal on a comparative basis. They base their vote solely on the proposal, and only weigh it in relation to other proposals when they vote on scheduling.


            iii.      Committee takes a straw vote for each proposal. Any proposal receiving a unanimous 'yes' vote is automatically passed. Any proposal receiving a unanimous 'no' vote does not pass, and there is no further discussion about it.


            iv.      All proposals that do not receive a unanimous yes or no from Committee are evaluated in the form of a list of pros and cons. Each Committee member presents at least one pro or one con in order to create these lists.


            v.      After ALL lists are made for each show being considered, the shows are discussed in greater detail and pro/cons are clarified if necessary.


            vi.      Once discussion is completed, Committee votes on each proposal. In this vote, proposals pass if they receive a simple majority of votes. A proposal must have at least half the votes in the room to pass.




        c.       _Scheduling._  Once shows are passed, they are then scheduled. At times, shows can be passed but not scheduled due to limited resources. During scheduling, other productions (such as the Weekend(s) of Workshops, or New Work Week(s) in the Spring) are also scheduled. Once the season has been scheduled, Committee votes on the entire season as scheduled, requiring a simple majority to pass. Committee then reflects upon the season as a whole. Mainstages and Collaborations that are scheduled for the UT season are assigned Committee Liaisons. The Weekend(s) of Workshops, New Work Week, or other such productions are also assigned liaisons at this time. If there are multiple Weekends of Workshops, each one receives its own liaison.




        d.      _Calling Proposers_.  After the season has been scheduled and reflected upon, Committee Liaisons will contact their respective proposers regarding the status of their proposal and its scheduling. The Committee member running the meeting contacts the proposers who shows were not scheduled. All Committee members must speak to their proposers by phone, _not_ via email or in person. The proposer must also be reached _directly_ by phone; voice mails are not permitted. Once all proposers have been reached directly by phone, the season may be announced by the Committee Chair via the UT general listhost.




        e.       _Post-Meeting Process: Mainstage._ Once scheduled, the staff of each Mainstage is encouraged to meet with UT/TAPS Pro-staff to continue to develop design plans, as well as to attend their respective cohorts. This is recommended for all shows, but immediately and especially important for shows intending to apply for a greater budget. They will also be reminded that to be cast, all actors must audition.




        f.       _Post-Meeting Process: Collaborations._  Once scheduled, Collaborators meet with the Managing Director of UT/TAPS to look at venue choice and run capacity, calculate potential ticket sales, and calculate a budget. In the event that a Collaborator wishes to do a free event, the RSO must have money from their own account to cover any production expenses. After this budgeting process, the rest of the production timeline is the same as for Mainstages: the staff of each Collaboration is encouraged to meet with UT/TAPS Pro-staff to continue to develop design plans, as well as to attend their respective cohorts.

        a.       Proposers are encouraged to meet with the Director of UT/TAPS to discuss their proposals. Proposers meet with the Managing Director to discuss rights, if applicable.


    b.      Proposers turn in their proposal by Friday of 6<sup>rd</sup> Week by 5pm to the Committee


        Chair's mailbox and electronically, either by fileshare (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. or emailed to executivesession@lists.uchicago.edu).


    c.       The proposal should include the following components:


            i.      Name and information about the proposer.


            ii.      Cast size and Gender (M/F/Either/Any) breakdown.


            iii.      Run time.


            iv.      Space/week preference, if there is an option (i.e., multiple Weekends of Workshops in different spaces).


            v.      Three important images pivotal to the play.


            vi.      The driving question and themes behind the production.


            vii.      The production design aesthetic of the play and the textual justification for the aesthetic choice.




    d.      The Workshops Proposal Meeting is held at the start of the 7<sup>th</sup> Week Committee


        Meeting, at 5pm. Each proposer has one minute to present their proposal and two minutes to answer the questions of Committee and community members.




    e.       After all proposers have spoken, they are excused and the Committee proceeds into


        the Executive (Closed) Session. Proposers who are also members of Committee are not allowed to sit in Executive Session Proposal Meeting or to vote on the Workshops. Once the Workshops have been voted on, proposers on Committee are permitted back into the room for the rest of the 7<sup>th</sup> Week Committee meeting, which proceeds as usual.



### Workshops Proposal Executive Session


    a.       Directly after the Workshops proposers have spoken, Committee goes into Executive


        Session to discuss each proposal individually. In this meeting, Committee considers whether a workshop:


            i.      Is appropriate to the proposer in terms of its scope and the proposer's relevant experience.


            ii.      Identifies the proposer's focused goals for the production and communicates that the proposer has a clear and specific vision of the play.


            iii.      Fits with University Theater's Mission Statement of Opportunity, Education, and Artistic Excellence.


            iv.      Is of feasible technical difficulty and requirements, given the Workshops format and restrictions, as well as current University Theater equipment and personnel.




    b.      _Procedure and Policy for the Workshops Proposal Meeting_


            i.      The Proposal Meeting is run by the Director of UT/TAPS and the Committee Chair. If the Chair is proposing, the Treasurer runs the meeting. If the Treasurer is also proposing, the Secretary runs the meeting. If all three officers are proposing, another member of Committee will be selected at the prior Committee meeting by simple majority vote.


            ii.      While the driving question in the Mainstage Proposal meeting is, "Why pass this show?" the driving question in the Workshops Proposal meeting is, "Why not?" in the interest of opportunity. To that end, each proposal is discussed briefly, addressing any concerns with the proposal.


            iii.      Progressing through each individual proposal in this way, Committee constructs a full lineup of Workshops.


            iv.      Committee then votes on this line up. If discussion is still required and/or if Committee is still divided upon the season, they may move to pass Workshops individually until the lineup is complete and all Proposals have been addressed.




    c.       _Scheduling._  In the event that there are multiple Weekends of Workshops,


        Workshops that pass must be scheduled into one of the weekends. Once the Weekend(s) have been scheduled, Committee votes on the entire Workshops lineup as scheduled, requiring a simple majority to pass. Committee then reflects upon the Workshops lineup as a whole.




        d.      _Calling Proposers_.  After the Workshops have been scheduled and reflected upon, the Committee Liaison(s) for Workshops will contact their various proposers regarding the status of their proposal and its scheduling. The Committee member running the meeting contacts the proposers whose shows were not scheduled. All Committee members must speak to their proposers by phone, _not_ via email or in person. The proposer must also be reached _directly_ by phone; voice mails are not permitted. Once all proposers have been reached directly by phone, the season may be announced by the Committee Chair via the UT general listhost.


        _ _


        e.       _Post-Meeting Process._ Once scheduled, the Director and SM of each Workshop are encouraged to meet with UT/TAPS Pro-staff to continue to develop design plans, as well as to attend their respective cohorts.
